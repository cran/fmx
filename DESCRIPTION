Title: Finite Mixture Parametrization
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2024-03-23
Description: A parametrization framework for finite mixture
      distribution using S4 objects. Density, cumulative
      density, quantile and simulation functions are
      defined. Currently normal, Tukey g-&-h, skew-normal
      and skew-t distributions are well tested. The gamma,
      negative binomial distributions are being tested.
