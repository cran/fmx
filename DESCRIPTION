Title: Finite Mixture Parametrization
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2024-04-04
Description: A parametrization framework for finite mixture
       distribution using S4 objects. Density, cumulative
       density, quantile and simulation functions are defined.
       Currently normal, Tukey g-&-h, skew-normal and skew-t
       distributions are well tested. The gamma, negative
       binomial distributions are being tested.
