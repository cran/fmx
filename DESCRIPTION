Title: Finite Mixture Parametrization
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2025-03-15
Description: A parametrization framework for finite mixture distribution
        using S4 objects. Density, cumulative density, quantile and
        simulation functions are defined. Currently normal, Tukey g-&-h,
        skew-normal and skew-t distributions are well tested. The gamma,
        negative binomial distributions are being tested.
